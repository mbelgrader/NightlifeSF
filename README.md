# NightlifeSF
Changing the way you find where to go out at night.

NightlifeSF is an interactive mobile app built with React-Naive and Rails. Used to find the best nightlife in SF.

Coming soon to the App Store and Play Store.

## Design

### Real-time

I setup in app messaging and notifications in real-time using a websocket connection, connecting the mobile app to the server using Rails Action Cable.
